## DwarvenX
DwarvenX aims to make the console version of Dwarf Fortress playable from within Neos.
To use it, you must download the Linux (or MacOS, I think) version of Dwarf Fortress as the Windows one does not support playing it in a terminal.

# Instructions
1. Download Dwarf Fortress (Linux version) and place it in the root of this repository, as a folder named "df_linux"
2. Install the python libraries websockets and pyte.
3. In Neos, either build your own display or find the one in my public folder. The latter should, once spawned, attempt to connect to the server.
4. Run dwarfToNeos.py and the Neos display should connect.
